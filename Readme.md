# <a name="top_of_page"></a>Welcome!

There are two parts to this code repository, **veins_master** directory contains relavent files for Veins, Omnet++, SUMO and Traci and the **sumo_master** directory which contains relavent files for SUMO/TraCI work that is independent of our veins work. Please follow the links to their appropriate readme:

[Veins Omnet++ SUMO TraCI](./veins_master/Readme.md)

[SUMO + TraCI](./sumo_master/Readme.md)

We are doing this research using [Instant Veins Virtual Machine](http://veins.car2x.org/documentation/instant-veins/) and running it with [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/virtualbox/index.html).
