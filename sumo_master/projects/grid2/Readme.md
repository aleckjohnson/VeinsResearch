A more ergonomic adaptation of [grid](../grid/Readme.md) that fits neatly on a 1366x768 resolution monitor. The map features a rectangular city with rectangular blocks. There is a four-lane high that goes through the center with the highest priority. The outer roads have the second highest priority and the inside streets have the lowest.
